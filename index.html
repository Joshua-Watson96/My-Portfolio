    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src = "assets/images/max-me.jpg" alt="Max-me" class = "float-right">
      <p> My name is Josh Watson, and I am 26 years old. 
        I use to be the 2IC/Manager of a 
        removals/logistics company for 6 years.
        I have always had a passion for Web/Software Development and coding.
        After managing the removals company and reaching my peak in the company, I thought it was time for
        a change and wanted to follow my passion from high school and get back
        into coding and eventually get a job in the industry and see where it takes me.
        I also have a dog named Max, and we have the same jumper.

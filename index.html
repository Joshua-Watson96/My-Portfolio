      <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
      <hr>
        <p> My name is Josh Watson and I am 26 years old. 
          I use to be the 2IC/Manager of a 
          removals/logistics company for 6 years.
          I have always had a passion for Web/Software Development and coding.
          After managing the removals company and reaching my peak in the company, I thought it was time for
          a change and wanted to follow my passion from high school and get back
          into coding and eventually get a job in the industry and see where it takes me.
